* Things to cover 
The idea is for this module to cover from beginning to end the setup of a
python project which performs a simple calculation, contains a command line
program (maybe), contains documentation, and is installable via pip and/or conda.

** Things to include
   - Python module setup
   - Documentation schemes
     - Doc strings (numpy style?)
     - sphinx autodoc
     - markdown with code execution
   - testing suit
     - I like pytest, but whatever
     - hooks?
   - Travis?
   - pip/conda installation?
   - python 2/3 support via six or future
